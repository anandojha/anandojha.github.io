title: "Selectivity and Ranking of Tight-Binding JAK-STAT Inhibitors Using Markovian Milestoning with Voronoi Tessellations"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper9
excerpt: 'Janus kinases (JAK), a group of proteins in the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (NRTKs) family, play a crucial role in 
growth, survival, and angiogenesis. They are activated by cytokines through the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of 
a transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway. JAK-STAT signaling pathways have significant roles in the regulation of cell 
division, apoptosis, and immunity. Identification of the V617F mutation in the Janus homology 2 (JH2) domain of JAK2 leading 
to myeloproliferative disorders has stimulated great interest in the drug discovery community to develop JAK2-specific inhibitors. 
However, such inhibitors should be selective toward JAK2 over other JAKs and display an extended residence time. Recently, 
novel JAK2/STAT5 axis inhibitors (N-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-amino derivatives) have displayed extended residence times 
(hours or longer) on target and adequate selectivity excluding JAK3. To facilitate a deeper understanding of the kinase-inhibitor 
interactions and advance the development of such inhibitors, we utilize a multiscale Markovian milestoning with Voronoi tessellations 
(MMVT) approach within the Simulation-Enabled Estimation of Kinetic Rates v.2 (SEEKR2) program to rank order these inhibitors based 
on their kinetic properties and further explain the selectivity of JAK2 inhibitors over JAK3. Our approach investigates the kinetic 
and thermodynamic properties of JAK–inhibitor complexes in a user-friendly, fast, efficient, and accurate manner compared to other 
brute force and hybrid-enhanced sampling approaches.'
