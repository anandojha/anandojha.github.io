title: 'Paper based field deployable sensor for naked eye monitoring of copper (II) ions; elucidation of binding mechanism by DFT studies'
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper3
excerpt: 'The study demonstrates the fabrication of test strips made from newly synthesized ortho-Vanillin based colorimetric 
chemosensor (probe P) that could be employed as field deployable tool for rapid and naked-eye detection of copper ions. Upon 
addition of copper ions to the chemosensor, it exhibits a rapid pink color from colorless and can be easily seen through the 
naked eye. This probe exhibits a remarkable colorimetric ON response, and the absorbance intensity of the probe is enhanced 
significantly in the presence of copper ions. The sensing mechanism has been deduced using FTIR, XPS, LCMS, and DFT studies. 
The binding mechanism of the probe to copper ions was substantiated by DFT studies. HOMO of the probe suggests that a high 
electronic density resides on oxygen and nitrogen atoms, and thus, these are the favorable binding sites for the metal ions.'
