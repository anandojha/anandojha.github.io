permalink: /publication/paper13
excerpt: 'The movement of organic anionic drugs across cell membranes is partly governed by interactions with SLC and ABC transporters in the intestine, liver, kidney, blood–brain barrier, placenta, breast, and other tissues. Major transporters involved include organic anion transporters (OATs, SLC22 family), organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs, SLCO family), and multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs, ABCC family). However, the sets of molecular properties of drugs that are necessary for interactions with OATs (OAT1, OAT3) vs. OATPs (OATP1B1, OATP1B3) vs. MRPs (MRP2, MRP4) are not well-understood. Defining these molecular properties is necessary for a better understanding of drug and metabolite handling across the gut–liver–kidney axis, gut–brain axis, and other multi-organ axes. It is also useful for tissue targeting of small molecule drugs and predicting drug–drug interactions and drug–metabolite interactions. Here, we curated a database of drugs shown to interact with these transporters in vitro and used chemoinformatic approaches to describe their molecular properties. We then sought to define sets of molecular properties that distinguish drugs interacting with OATs, OATPs, and MRPs in binary classifications using machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches. We identified sets of key molecular properties (e.g., rotatable bond count, lipophilicity, number of ringed structures) for classifying OATs vs. MRPs and OATs vs. OATPs. However, sets of molecular properties differentiating OATP vs. MRP substrates were less evident, as drugs interacting with MRP2 and MRP4 do not form a tight group owing to differing hydrophobicity and molecular complexity for interactions with the two transporters. If the results also hold for endogenous metabolites, they may deepen our knowledge of organ crosstalk, as described in the Remote Sensing and Signaling Theory. The results also provide a molecular basis for understanding how small organic molecules differentially interact with OATs, OATPs, and MRPs.'
