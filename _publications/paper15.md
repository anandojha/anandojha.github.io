title: "Advances and Challenges in Milestoning Simulations for Drug–Target Kinetics"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper15
excerpt: 'Molecular dynamics simulations have become indispensable for exploring complex biological processes, yet their limitations in capturing rare events hinder our understanding of drug–target kinetics. In this Perspective, we investigate the domain of milestoning simulations to understand this challenge. The milestoning approach divides the phase space of the drug–target complex into discrete cells, offering extended time scale insights. This Perspective traces the history, applications, and future potential of milestoning simulations in the context of drug–target kinetics. It explores the fundamental principles of milestoning, highlighting the importance of probabilistic transitions and transition time independence. Markovian milestoning with Voronoi tessellations is revisited to address the traditional milestoning challenges. While observing the advancements in this field, this Perspective also addresses impending challenges in estimating drug–target unbinding rate constants through milestoning simulations, paving the way for more effective drug design strategies.'

Molecular dynamics simulations have become indispensable for exploring complex biological processes, yet their limitations in capturing rare events hinder our understanding of drug–target kinetics. In this Perspective, we investigate the domain of milestoning simulations to understand this challenge. The milestoning approach divides the phase space of the drug–target complex into discrete cells, offering extended time scale insights. This Perspective traces the history, applications, and future potential of milestoning simulations in the context of drug–target kinetics. It explores the fundamental principles of milestoning, highlighting the importance of probabilistic transitions and transition time independence. Markovian milestoning with Voronoi tessellations is revisited to address the traditional milestoning challenges. While observing the advancements in this field, this Perspective also addresses impending challenges in estimating drug–target unbinding rate constants through milestoning simulations, paving the way for more effective drug design strategies.
