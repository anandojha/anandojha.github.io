excerpt: 'A 5-fold-interpenetrated zinc-based coordination polymer can discriminately detect aliphatic amines through a fluorescence “turn-on” method. 
This compound can sense aliphatic amines in the solid state, solution state, and vapor phase. Theoretical calculations revealed that the ground-state 
dipole moment of the corresponding amines guides the order of enhancement.'

A 5-fold-interpenetrated zinc-based coordination polymer can discriminately detect aliphatic amines through a fluorescence “turn-on” method. 
This compound can sense aliphatic amines in the solid state, solution state, and vapor phase. Theoretical calculations revealed that the ground-state 
dipole moment of the corresponding amines guides the order of enhancement.
